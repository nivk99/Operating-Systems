Another year, another death, figuratively and ultimately literally, for poor postpartum moms in Mississippi. On February 2 the Mississippi Senate overwhelmingly passed Senate Bill 2033 “to authorize and direct the division of Medicaid to provide up to 12 months of continuous postpartum coverage for any individual who qualifies for Medicaid.” The vote was 46 yeas, 5 nays, and 1 absent, including 30 Republicans in favor. The legislation then went to the House on February 7 and died on the calendar on March 9 without a vote, under MS House Speaker Philip Gunn.

The Mississippi Maternal Mortality Report (2013-2016) found that nearly 40% of pregnancy-related deaths happen after the baby is six weeks old. In February 2021, the Center for Mississippi Health Policy reported key findings: “3 in 5 maternal deaths in the U.S. are preventable, and that 86% of maternal deaths in Mississippi occur postpartum, and that black women are 3X more likely to die from pregnancy complications than white women.”

It’s important to note that loss of postpartum life seems perfectly acceptable to both Gov. Tate Reeves and Gunn (R-56), yet they staunchly support the MS Attorney General’s Anti-abortion efforts. 

Here in the poorest state in the country, poor postpartum women die every year, leaving motherless children – despite the Federal Government paying over 85% of infant and mother’s healthcare costs through Medicaid.

The Kaiser Family Foundation reports that 39 states (DC included) have adopted Medicaid Expansion, and 12 have not. No other state has a higher African-American population than Mississippi at 38%, and just under 38% of citizens here live below the poverty level; with nearly 13% of those being white.

I visited the Capitol parking lot early Friday, March 11, in hopes of speaking to legislators about their votes (senators), and lack of votes (representatives) and was met with a mixture of responses. After introducing myself and indicating that I was working on a story for The Mississippi Link, I was only able to speak with eight representatives. One of them informed me that the Senate had gaveled out the previous night. 

A white female representative that I have been unable to identify stated, “No – I don’t speak to reporters,” and then informed security about me as if I had done something wrong by asking for one minute of her time.

I found it interesting that she installed a steering wheel lock when her car was parked only twelve or so steps from the side entrance to the Capitol.
